  <p>According to its website, the <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/">CSS Zen Garden</a> is “a demonstration of what can be accomplished through CSS-based design.” The website is both a gallery of inspiring examples of web design and a challenge to would be CSS masters. The rules of the challenge are as follows:
    <ol>
      <li>Download one <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/examples/index">HTML file</a> and one <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/examples/style.css">CSS file</a> (provided by the site)</li>
      <li>Modify the stylesheet in any way you wish, but not the HTML</li>
    </ol>
  Due by the start of <span class="highlight">next class</span>.</p>

    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>The CSS Zen Garden was created in 2003 by <a href="http://www.mezzoblue.com/about/dave/">Dave Shea</a> during an exciting time of transition within the web design community. In this same year <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/">Jeffrey Zeldman</a> released the seminal book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Designing_with_Web_Standards">Designing with Web Standards</a> promoting the use of semantic HTML markup, separation of content from presentation and a denouncement of <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/journey">table-based layouts</a>. CSS Zen Garden proved to skeptical web designers that beautiful layouts using CSS were possible.</p>
    <p>For the ten year anniversary of the Garden, in 2013, Shea, re-opened the garden to submissions. He updated for the first time the HTML, using modern best practice including new tags such as header, section, aside, footer, nav and adding ARIA roles. He ported all of the old (official) CSS themes to use the new markup and re-launched on GitHub. Browse through the hundreds of themes created since 2003, get inspired, and start coding.</p>
