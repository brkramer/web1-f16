  <p>You will now start the last new project of the semester. It is a right of passage in all web design courses taught at art schools to create a personal portfolio website. Your task is to create a personal portfolio website to showcase your work. Just with your client website, it is important to consider why you are making a portfolio website, what you hope to achieve with it. This will help keep you focused on features that matter most as you build out your site.</p>
  <p>By the end of the semester a completed <i>Personal Portfolio</i> site including HTML, CSS and content (text and imagery) is required. You do not need to have all of your images and content done, but enough to give us an understanding of the entirety of the site design.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Practice building a website from scratch now that you have completed several small sites.</li>
      <li>Contrast the process of building a site for yourself versus building one for a client.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Deliverables</h2>
    <p>Due by the start of <span class="highlight">next class</span>.</p>

    </ul>

    <h3>Goals</h3>
    Why do you need a personal portfolio? Do you want to include it as a link on potential job applications? What do you want to convey? Are you an illustrator, what types of illustrations do you make? Will you show all of your work, or just some? What story do you want to tell about yourself?

  <section>
    <h2>Revisions</h2>
    <p>The following are suggested incremental steps towards moving your projects forward. They do not have a fixed due date, manage your time appropriately.</p>
    
    <ol class="sections">
      <li>Create CSS stylesheets for your <i>Client Site</i>. Start with font, margin, padding, color and image size styling. Once you have that looking good start working on CSS layout.</li>
			<li>Look back at your <i>Event Promotion</i> and <i>Visual Portfolio</i> sites. Would you benefit from any embeds like SoundCloud, YouTube, or JavaScript libraries like Carousel or LightBox?. Make any improvements you deem necessary.</li>
    </ol>
